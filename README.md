You may already know how to use HTML and CSS to create websites. If so, you're ready to add more power to your programming with JavaScript. This programming language lets you add interactivity to your pages by creating features such as buttons, picture carousels, and collapsible panels to your Web pages.

The course begins with the basics of JavaScript code and then moves on to more advanced topics. You'll learn how to define what happens when a user clicks a button or presses a key on your pages, and see how JavaScript enables your pages to make "if . . . then . . . else" decisions about what to do based on circumstances. You'll also get a chance to try out loops and timers to create animation effects. Throughout the course, you'll get plenty of hands-on practice to give you the experience you need to really understand how JavaScript works.

And since no JavaScript course would be complete without a discussion of jQuery, we cover it as well. This free "write less, do more" JavaScript library has become virtually synonymous with modern Web and mobile app development. By the end of the course, you'll understand how to use jQuery to catapult your basic JavaScript knowledge to incredible new heights.

This course assumes students already know HTML and CSS. JavaScript is always used with these two programming languages, not as an alternative to them.
