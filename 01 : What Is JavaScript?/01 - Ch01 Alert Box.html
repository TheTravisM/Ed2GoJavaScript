<!--

So your assignment will simply be to change the contents of the alert box to read Goodbye World rather than Hello World. 
Make sure you test your code after making the change, and verify that the correct words show up in the alert box when you first open the page in a browser. 
Try it on your own first, without peeking at the instructions. 
If you can't figure it out, you can click Steps below to see step-by-step instructions.
